Progressive web app, which shows useful information when hunting northern lights. It gets it data by directly 
fetching it from MET Norway and SWPC NOAA. There is no middle-man, which is mostly why I made this app.

## Credits
- All data related to space weather is from [USA National Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov).
- All weather data is from [MET Norway](https://met.no).

- Location name is pulled from [geocode](https://geocode.xyz/api).
